# `Angular CLI` Installation Guide

### Pre-requisite:
- `node.js` runtime environment.
- `npm` package manager. 

(check the installation guide in this repo's Node directory)

### Step:
Open `Terminal` and type this cmd:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
**Note**: `-g` refers to global and if you want to install the CLI locally, use the above command without using `-g`.
